FLAC-Convert is a script that automatically converts flac files into
MP3 (320kbps, V0, V2), OGG, and AAC.


Features:
 - Multithreaded conversion.
 - On demand conversion on a directory tree. Only new and changed
   files are converted.
 - Automatic creation of torrent files for each directory (album)


Usage:
 - Customize your settings at the top of the script.
 - Comment out conv_arr entries for the formats you do not want to
   encode.
 - Run the script.


Requirements:
 - LAME (for MP3 encoding)
 - flac
 - mktorrent (for torrent file creation)
 - vorbis-tools (for ogg encoding)
 - faac (for AAC encoding)

more file formats can easily be added.


Known issues:
 - Minimal error handling
 - There must not be any existing jobs running in the background when
   the script is launched.
